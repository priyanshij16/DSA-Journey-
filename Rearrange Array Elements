2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

You should return the array of nums such that the the array follows the given conditions:

Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditios

Code :
1 take one vector of size n and pos=0, neg=0
2 iterate loop from 0 to n 
3 check if(a[i]>0 )                
  result[posIndex] = nums[i];
 increment postive counter by 2
4 else neg+=2; 
result[neg] = nums[i] 

4 return resl
