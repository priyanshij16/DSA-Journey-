Stock Buy and Sell | (DP-35)
 EX:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Code : O(n)
  int profit =0, mini= prices[0];
        for(int i=0; i<prices.size();i++){
            profit= max(profit,prices[i]-mini);
            mini= min(mini, prices[i]);
        }
        return profit;
